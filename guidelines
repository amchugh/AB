|                     FILES                       |
|-------------------------------------------------|

.encr file:
| Contains the information for one encounter (wild battles or trainer battles)

.rgn file:
| Contains region information

.ent files:

| 
| Schematic:
| Replace the hard brackets plus word with the correct value
| *Spaces are important*
| "//" are comments
| "subid" means the id is specific to the file.
| meanwhile, "id"s are global across the entire dataset for the game
| -------------------------------------------
| 0| [map id]
| 1| [width]x[height]
| 2| [tile id] [tile id] [tile id] [tile id] ...     // there should be width*height entries in this line
| 3| [region id] [tile number] [tile number] [tile number] ... // There should be as many of these lines as nessecary
| 4|  
| 7| [entity id] [tile number] [entity id] [tile number] ... // There can be as many entities as needed
| -------------------------------------------
| 
| Here's an example:
| |------------------|
| |"map1.map"        |
| |------------------|
| |0                 |
| |3x3               |
| |0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 |
| |0 0 1 2 4         |
| |1 0 3 6           |
| |                  |
| |0 0 0.2 1 1       |
| |                  |
